# Milestone-Project-1


My thought was to create a matching game for children (5th graders) to use to study science vocabulary. 
A matching game is what I thought could help. The user would need to match the vocabulary word to the image that matches best. 
The user will also need to be able to remember what card contained what image or vocabulary word. 
When the user makes a match, they should receive a message that they got the match correct or a message saying they need to try again. 
The user will know they have won the game, when they have matched all the vocabulary words and images correctly.
