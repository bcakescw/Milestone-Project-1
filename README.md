# Milestone-Project-1

**Inspiration**:
My inspiration comes from a student I had in my class this past school year. I taught second grade and they struggled to read and write. They were tested at the end of the school year to see if they have a learning disability. It was found that they do. Their learning disablility is in their working memory. They have a very difficult time remember things in their working  memory. They will need to practice things many, many times and learn how to compensate for this memory issue. 

This game would be a great resource for this child to play, to help them work on their working memory. Since this would be for a child with poor working  memory, I decided to give the game fun colors, cute puppy pictures, and music to help them want to be on the site longer. 

**Controls**:
The player just needs to click on the yellow squares with their mouse. Once they click on a yellow square, the square should flip to show an image of a puppy. Either the images will match or will be wrong. If the images match, the player will continue to see the image. If the images do not match, the card will flip back over and the player will see the yellow square again. The player will then click two yellow squares again to get see if the images underneath will match. Once there are no more yellow squares to be seen, the player has won the game. 

**Technologies Used**:
In Javascript:
- If, else statements were used to help identify if cards match.
In CSS:
- Transitions and transformations were used to get the cards to flip.
- Pointerevents were used

**Unfinished Functionality**
Have a reset button that works, when clicked. Once a match is made and the reset button is clicked, the cards will turn to their blank side. The bug is that the cards are supposed to randomize again and be clickable. They do not randomize, and the onces that match are no longer clickable.
