# Milestone-Project-1

**Inspiration**:
My inspiration comes from a student I had in my class this past school year. I taught second grade and they struggled to read and write. They were tested at the end of the school year to see if they have a learning disability. It was found that they do. Their learning disablility is in their working memory. They have a very difficult time remember things in their working  memory. They will need to practice things many, many times and learn how to compensate for this memory issue. 

This game would be a great resource for this child to play, to help them work on their working memory. Since this would be for a child with poor working  memory, I decided to give the game fun colors, cute puppy pictures, and music to help them want to be on the site longer.
